# âœ… DayZ Market Tool - PBO Detection Fix Complete

## ðŸ”§ Problem Solved

**Root Cause**: Case sensitivity inconsistency between debug code and PBO extraction logic
- `mod_processor.py`: Used case-sensitive `.pbo` detection
- `pbo_parser.py`: Used case-insensitive `.pbo` detection
- Real DayZ mods often have `.PBO` (uppercase) files that were missed

## âœ… Fixes Applied

### 1. **Case Sensitivity Consistency**
- Fixed `mod_processor.py` to use case-insensitive PBO detection
- Now detects `.pbo`, `.PBO`, `.Pbo` and all variations
- Consistent behavior across all PBO detection code

### 2. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added comprehensive PBO signature validation logging
- Shows file sizes, signatures, and extraction status
- Detailed error reporting for failed extractions
- Separate tracking of case-sensitive vs case-insensitive detection

### 3. **Improved Error Messages**
- Better user feedback when PBO files aren't found
- Shows debugging information to help diagnose issues
- Clearer guidance on expected mod folder structure

## ðŸ§ª Test Results

### Case Sensitivity Test
```
âœ… Case-insensitive detection: Found 3 PBO files (test3.Pbo, test2.PBO, test1.pbo)
âœ… Case-sensitive detection: Found 1 PBO file (test1.pbo)
âœ… PBO extraction: Successfully extracted all 3 files
âœ… Signature validation: All files have valid PBO signatures
```

### Complete Workflow Test
```
âœ… GUI ModProcessor Results:
   - Success: True
   - PBO files: 3
   - XML files: 2
   - Items found: 2 (Morphine, Epinephrine)
```

## ðŸš€ Ready for Windows Build

The application now correctly:
- Detects PBO files regardless of case (.pbo, .PBO, .Pbo)
- Extracts PBO contents with detailed logging
- Parses XML files and processes items
- Provides clear error messages when issues occur

All fixes are ready for Windows executable generation via GitHub Actions.
